      <p>Ironwill was founded in 2007 by a group of passionate dragon boat enthusiasts from the Tampines Changkat community. Their vision was clear: to create a competitive yet deeply supportive team environment where members could push their limits while forging strong bonds.</p>
      <p>Initial challenges included securing training equipment and attracting members, but the founders' dedication and the shared love for the sport quickly built momentum. The first few training sessions at the bedok reservior marked the humble beginnings of a team destined for growth.</p>
